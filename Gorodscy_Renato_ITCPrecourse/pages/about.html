        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div class="about-me">
            <p>I'm interested in coding because of one of my past professional experiences. I've had the opportunity to
                work with a team that built an ecommerce, and my main responsibility was to choose which platform we
                would work with, and do the basic building and styling of the page, based in guidelines from the
                designer.<br>
                I've enjoyed very much doing this, so I've started self learning a little bit of coding, with basic
                Python, and then HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
            <p> My Educational experience is mainly in Business, with both Bachelors and Masters in the field.<br>
                In terms of professional experience, I've worked as Business Analyst, Fundraising Manager and different
                setups in Sales, in addition to the experience with the ecommerce that I've already mentioned.</p>
            <p>My main personal interests are watching movies/series, riding bike and understanding how things actually
                work, in
                varied subjects.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="map-div">
            <p> I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, and lived there until making Aliyah, in March of 2022. I've also visited Paris
                and London.</p>
